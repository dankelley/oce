\title{Fit a Tidal Model to a Timeseries}
\usage{
tidem(
  t,
  x,
  constituents,
  infer = NULL,
  latitude = NULL,
  rc = 1,
  regress = lm,
  debug = getOption("oceDebug")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{either a vector of times or a \linkS4class{sealevel} object
(as created with \code{\link[=read.sealevel]{read.sealevel()}} or \code{\link[=as.sealevel]{as.sealevel()}}).
In the first case, \code{x} must be provided.  In the second
case, though, any \code{x} that is provided will be ignored,
because sealevel objects contain both \code{time} and water
\code{elevation}, and the latter is used for \code{x}.}

\item{x}{an optional numerical vector holding something that varies with
time.  This is ignored if \code{t} is a \linkS4class{sealevel} object,
because it is inferred automatically, using \code{t[["elevation"]]}.}

\item{constituents}{an optional character vector holding the names
of tidal constituents to which the fit is done; see \dQuote{Details}
and \dQuote{Constituent Naming Convention}.}

\item{infer}{a list of constituents to be inferred from
fitted constituents according to the method outlined
in Section 2.3.4 of Foreman (1978).
If \code{infer} is \code{NULL}, the default, then
no such inferences are made. Otherwise, some constituents
are computed based on other constituents, instead of being
determined by regression at the proper frequency.
If provided, \code{infer} must be a list containing
four elements:
\code{name}, a vector of strings naming the constituents to be
inferred; \code{from}, a vector of strings naming the fitted
constituents used as the sources for those inferences (these
source constituents are added to the regression list, if they
are not already there);
\code{amp}, a numerical vector of factors to be applied to the
source amplitudes; and \code{phase}, a numerical vector of angles,
in degrees, to be subtracted from the source phases. For example,
Following Foreman (1998), if any of the \code{name} items
have already been computed, then the suggested inference is ignored,
and the already-computed values are used.
\preformatted{
infer=list(name=c("P1","K2"),
           from=c("K1", "S2"),
           amp=c(0.33093, 0.27215),
           phase=c(-7.07, -22.4)
}
means that the amplitude of \code{P1} will be set as 0.33093 times the calculated amplitude
of \code{K1}, and that the \code{P1} phase will be set to the \code{K1} phase,
minus an offset of \code{-7.07} degrees.
(This example is used in the Foreman (1978) discussion of a
Fortran analysis code and also in Pawlowicz et al. (2002) discussion
of the T_TIDE Matlab code.
Rounded to the 0.1mm resolution of values reported in Foreman (1978)
and Pawlowicz et al. (2002),
the \code{tidem} results have root-mean-square amplitude difference
to Foreman's (1978) Appendix 7.3 of 0.06mm; by comparison,
the results in Table 1 of Pawlowicz et al. (2002) agree with Foreman's
results to RMS difference 0.04mm.)}

\item{latitude}{if provided, the latitude of the observations.  If not
provided, \code{tidem} will try to infer this from the first argument,
if it is a \linkS4class{sealevel} object.}

\item{rc}{the value of the coefficient in the Rayleigh criterion.}

\item{regress}{function to be used for regression, by default
\code{\link[=lm]{lm()}}, but could be for example \code{rlm} from the
\code{MASS} package.}

\item{debug}{an integer specifying whether debugging information is
to be printed during the processing. This is a general parameter that
is used by many \code{oce} functions. Generally, setting \code{debug=0}
turns off the printing, while higher values suggest that more information
be printed. If one function calls another, it usually reduces the value of
\code{debug} first, so that a user can often obtain deeper debugging
by specifying higher \code{debug} values.}
}
\value{
An object of \linkS4class{tidem}, consisting of
\item{const}{constituent number, e.g. 1 for \code{Z0}, 1 for \code{SA},
etc.} \item{model}{the regression model} \item{name}{a vector of constituent
names, in non-subscript format, e.g. "\code{M2}".} \item{frequency}{a vector
of constituent frequencies, in inverse hours.} \item{amplitude}{a vector of
fitted constituent amplitudes, in metres.} \item{phase}{a vector of fitted
constituent phase.  NOTE: The definition of phase is likely to change as
this function evolves.  For now, it is phase with respect to the first data
sample.} \item{p}{a vector containing a sort of p value for each
constituent.  This is calculated as the average of the p values for the
sine() and cosine() portions used in fitting; whether it makes any sense is
an open question.}
}
\description{
The fit is done in terms of sine and cosine components at the indicated
tidal frequencies (after possibly pruning to satisfy the Rayleigh criterion,
as explained in phase 2 of the procedure outlined in
'\sQuote{Details}), with the amplitude and phase being
calculated from the resultant coefficients on the sine and cosine terms.
The scheme was devised for hourly data; for other sampling schemes,
see \dQuote{Application to non-hourly data}.

\details{
A summary of constituents used by \code{\link[=tidem]{tidem()}} may be found with:
\preformatted{
data(tidedata)
print(tidedata$const)
}

A multi-stage procedure is used to establish the list of tidal
constituents to be used in the fit.

\emph{Phase 1: initial selection.}

The initial list tidal constituents (prior to the pruning phase described
below) to be used in the analysis are specified as follows;
see \dQuote{Constituent Naming Convention}.
\enumerate{
\item If \code{constituents} is not provided, then the constituent
list will be made up of the 69 constituents designated by Foreman as "standard".
These include astronomical frequencies and some shallow-water frequencies,
and are as follows: \code{c("Z0", "SA", "SSA", "MSM", "MM", "MSF", "MF", "ALP1", "2Q1", "SIG1", "Q1", "RHO1", "O1", "TAU1", "BET1", "NO1", "CHI1", "PI1", "P1", "S1", "K1", "PSI1", "PHI1", "THE1", "J1", "SO1", "OO1", "UPS1", "OQ2", "EPS2", "2N2", "MU2", "N2", "NU2", "GAM2", "H1", "M2", "H2", "MKS2", "LDA2", "L2", "T2", "S2", "R2", "K2", "MSN2", "ETA2", "MO3", "M3", "SO3", "MK3", "SK3", "MN4", "M4", "SN4", "MS4", "MK4", "S4", "SK4", "2MK5", "2SK5", "2MN6", "M6", "2MS6", "2MK6", "2SM6", "MSK6", "3MK7", "M8")}.
\item If the first item in \code{constituents} is the string
\code{"standard"}, then a provisional list is set up as in Case 1, and then
the (optional) rest of the elements of \code{constituents} are examined, in
order.  Each of these constituents is based on the name of a tidal
constituent in the Foreman (1978) notation.  (To get the list, execute
\code{data(tidedata)} and then execute \code{cat(tideData$name)}.)  Each
named constituent is added to the existing list, if it is not already there.
But, if the constituent is preceded by a minus sign, then it is removed
from the list (if it is already there).  Thus, for example, a user
might specify \code{constituents=c("standard", "-M2", "ST32")} to remove the M2
constituent and add the ST32 constituent.
\item If the first item is not \code{"standard"}, then the list of
constituents is processed as in Case 2, but without starting with the
standard list. As an example, \code{constituents=c("K1", "M2")} would fit
for just the K1 and M2 components. (It would be strange to use a minus sign
to remove items from the list, but the function allows that.)
}

In each of the above cases, the list is reordered in frequency prior to the
analysis, so that the results of \code{\link[=summary,tidem-method]{summary,tidem-method()}} will be in a
familiar form.

\emph{Phase 2: pruning based on Rayleigh's criterion.}

Once the initial constituent list is determined during Phase 1,
\code{tidem} applies the Rayleigh criterion, which holds that
constituents of frequencies \eqn{f_1}{f1} and \eqn{f_2}{f2} cannot be
resolved unless the time series spans a time interval of at least
\eqn{rc/(f_1-f_2)}{rc/(f1-f2)}.  The details of the decision of which
constituent to prune is fairly complicated, involving decisions
based on a comparison table.  The details of this process are provided
by Foreman (1978).

\emph{Phase 3: optionally overruling Rayleigh's criterion.}

The pruning list from phase 2 can be overruled by the user. This
is done by retaining any constituents that the user has named
in the \code{constituents} parameter.  This action
was added on 2017-12-27, to make \code{tidem} behave the same
way as the Foreman (1978) code, as illustrated in his
Appendices 7.2 and 7.3. (As an aside, his Appendix 7.3 has some errors,
e.g. the frequency for the 2SK5 constituent is listed there (p58) as
0.20844743, but it is listed as 0.2084474129 in his Appendix 7.1 (p41).
For this reason, the frequency comparison is relaxed to a \code{tol}
value of \code{1e-7} in a portion of the oce test suite
(see \code{tests/testthat/test_tidem.R} in the source).

\emph{Comments on phases 2 and 3}

A specific example may be of help in understanding the removal of unresolvable
constituents. For example, the \code{data(sealevel)} dataset is of length
6718 hours, and this is too short to resolve the full list of constituents,
with the conventional (and, really, necessary) limit of \code{rc=1}.
From Table 1 of Foreman (1978), this timeseries is too short to resolve the
\code{SA} constituent, so that \code{SA} will not be in the resultant.
Similarly, Table 2 of Foreman (1978) dictates the removal of
\code{PI1}, \code{S1} and \code{PSI1} from the list. And, finally,
Table 3 of Foreman (1978) dictates the removal of
\code{H1}, \code{H2}, \code{T2} and \code{R2}, and since that document
suggests that \code{GAM2} be subsumed into \code{H1},
then if \code{H1} is already being deleted, then
\code{GAM2} will also be deleted.
}
\section{Application to non-hourly data}{


The framework on which \code{\link[=tidem]{tidem()}} rests on the assumption of data
that have been sampled on a 1-hour interval (see e.g. Foreman, 1977).
Since regression (as opposed to spectral analysis) is used to infer
the amplitude and phase of tidal constituents, data gaps do not pose
a serious problem. Sampling intervals under an hour are also not a
problem. However, trying to use \code{\link[=tidem]{tidem()}} on time series that are
sampled at uniform intervals that exceed 1 hour can lead to results
that are difficult to interpret.  For example, some drifter data are
sampled at a 6-hour interval.  This makes it impossible to fit for the
S4 component (which has exactly 6 cycles per day), because the method
works by constructing sine and cosine series at tidal frequencies and
using these as the basis for regression.  Each of these series will have
a constant value through the constructed time, and regression cannot handle
that (in addition to a constant-value constructed series that is used to fit
for the Z0 constituent).  \code{\link[=tidem]{tidem()}} tries to handle such problems by examining
the range of the constructed sine and cosine time-series, omitting any
constituents that yield near-constant values in either of these. Messages are
issued if this problem is encountered.  This prevents failure of the regression,
and the predictions of the regression seem to represent the data reasonably well,
but the inferred constituent amplitudes are not physically reasonable. Cautious
use of \code{\link[=tidem]{tidem()}} to infer individual constituents might be warranted, but
users must be aware that the results will be difficult to interpret. The tool
is simply not designed for this use.
}

\section{Bugs}{


\enumerate{
\item This function is not fully developed yet, and both the
form of the call and the results of the calculation may change.

\item The reported \code{p} value may make no sense at all, and it might be
removed in a future version of this function. Perhaps a significance level
should be presented, as in the software developed by both Foreman and
Pawlowicz.

}
}

\section{Constituent Naming Convention}{


\code{tidem} uses constituent names that follow the convention
set by Foreman (1978). This convention is slightly different
from that used in the T-TIDE package of Pawlowicz et al.
(2002), with Foreman's \code{UPS1} and \code{M8} becoming
\code{UPSI} and \code{MS} in T-TIDE. To permit the use of either notation,
\code{\link[=tidem]{tidem()}} uses \code{\link[=tidemConstituentNameFix]{tidemConstituentNameFix()}} to
convert from T-TIDE names to the
Foreman names, issuing warnings when doing so.
}

\section{Agreement with \code{T_TIDE} results}{


The \code{tidem} amplitude and phase results, obtained with

tidem(sealevelTuktoyaktuk, constituents=c("standard", "M10"),
    infer=list(name=c("P1", "K2"),
        from=c("K1", "S2"),
        amp=c(0.33093, 0.27215),
        phase=c(-7.07, -22.40)))
}
match the \code{T_TIDE} values listed in
Table 1 of Pawlowicz et al. (2002),
after rounding amplitude and phase to 4 and 2 digits past
the decimal place, respectively, to match the format of
that table.

\title{Composite by Averaging Across Data}
\usage{
\S4method{composite}{list}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{\link{list}} of \link{oce-class} objects.}
}
\description{
This is done
by calling a specialized version of the function defined in the given
class. In the present
version, the objects must inherit from \link{amsr-class}, so the
action is to call
\code{\link{composite,amsr-method}}.

Items within the \code{data} slots of the
objects that are supplied as arguments are averaged in a way that
makes sense for the object class, i.e. taking into account
the particular bad-data codes of that particular class.

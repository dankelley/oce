\description{
Determines the full name of a file, including the path.  Used by many
\code{read.X} routines, where \code{X} is the name of a class of object.
This is a wrapper around \code{\link{normalizePath}}, with warnings turned
off so that messages are not printed for unfound files (e.g. URLs).

\title{Window an oce Object by Time or Distance}
\usage{
\method{window}{oce}(
  x,
  start = NULL,
  end = NULL,
  frequency = NULL,
  deltat = NULL,
  extend = FALSE,
  which = c("time", "distance"),
  indexReturn = FALSE,
  debug = getOption("oceDebug"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an \linkS4class{oce} object.}

\item{start}{the start time (or distance) of the time (or space) region of
interest.  This may be a single value or a vector.}

\item{end}{the end time (or distance) of the time (or space) region of
interest.  This may be a single value or a vector.}

\item{frequency}{not permitted yet.}

\item{deltat}{not permitted yet}

\item{extend}{not permitted yet}

\item{which}{string containing the name of the quantity on which sampling is
done.  Possibilities are \code{"time"}, which applies the windowing on the
\code{time} entry of the \code{data} slot, and \code{"distance"}, for the
\code{distance} entry (for those objects, such as \code{adp}, that have this
entry).}

\item{indexReturn}{boolean flag indicating whether to return a list of the
"kept" indices for the \code{time} entry of the \code{data} slot, as well as
the \code{timeSlow} entry, if there is one..  Either of these lists will be
\code{NULL}, if the object lacks the relevant items.}

\item{debug}{a flag that turns on debugging.}

\item{\dots}{ignored}
}
\value{
Normally, this is new \code{oce} object.  However, if
\code{indexReturn=TRUE}, the return value is two-element list containing
items named \code{index} and \code{indexSlow}, which are the indices for the
\code{time} entry of the \code{data} slot (and the \code{timeSlow}, if it
exists).
}
\description{
Windows \code{x} on either time or distance, depending on the value of
\code{which}.  In each case, values of \code{start} and \code{end} may be
integers, to indicate a portion of the time or distance range.  If
\code{which} is \code{"time"}, then the \code{start} and \code{end} values
may also be provided as POSIX times, or character strings indicating times
(in time zone given by the value of \code{getOption("oceTz")}).
Note that \code{\link[=subset]{subset()}} may be more useful than this function.

\examples{
library(oce)
data(adp)
plot(adp)
early <- window(adp, start = "2008-06-26 00:00:00", end = "2008-06-26 12:00:00")
plot(early)
bottom <- window(adp, start = 0, end = 20, which = "distance")
plot(bottom)

\code{\link[=subset]{subset()}} provides more flexible selection of subsets.

\title{Earth Magnetic Declination, Inclination, and Intensity}
\usage{
magneticField(longitude, latitude, time, version = 13)
}
\arguments{
\item{longitude}{longitude in degrees east (negative for degrees west), as a
number, a vector, or a matrix.}

\item{latitude}{latitude in degrees north, as a number, vector, or matrix.
The shape (length or dimensions) must conform to the dimensions of \code{longitude}.}

\item{time}{The time at which the field is desired. This may be a
single value or a vector or matrix that is structured to match
\code{longitude} and \code{latitude}. The value may a decimal year,
a POSIXt time, or a Date time.}

\item{version}{an integer that must be either 12 or 13, to specify
the version number of the formulae. Note that 13 became the default
on 2020 March 3, so to old code will need to specify \code{version=12}
to work as it did before that date.}
}
\value{
A list containing \code{declination}, \code{inclination}, and
\code{intensity}.
}
\description{
Implements the 12th and 13th generations of the
International Geomagnetic Reference Field
(IGRF), based on a reworked version of a Fortran program downloaded from a
NOAA website (see \dQuote{References}).
}
\details{
The code (subroutines \code{igrf12syn} and \code{igrf13syn}) seem to have
been written by Susan Macmillan of the British Geological Survey.  Comments
in the source code \code{igrf13syn} (the current default used here)
indicate that its coefficients were agreed to in
December 2019 by the IAGA Working Group V-MOD.  Other comments in that code
suggest that the proposed application time interval is from years 1900 to 2025, inclusive,
but that only dates from 1945 to 2015 are to be considered definitive.

\section{Historical Notes}{

For about a decade, \code{magneticField} used the version 12 formulae provided
by IAGA, but the code was updated on March 3, 2020, to version 13.  Example
3 shows that the differences in declination are typically under 2 degrees
(with 95 percent of the data lying between -1.7 and 0.7 degrees).

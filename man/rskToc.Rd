\title{Decode Table-of-Contents From an rsk File}
\usage{
rskToc(dir, from, to, debug = getOption("oceDebug"))
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{name of a directory containing a single table-of-contents file, with
\code{.TBL} at the end of its file name.}

\item{from}{optional \code{\link[=POSIXct]{POSIXct()}} time, indicating the beginning of a
data interval of interest.  This must have timezone \code{"UTC"}.}

\item{to}{optional \code{\link[=POSIXct]{POSIXct()}} time, indicating the end of a data
interval of interest.  This must have timezone \code{"UTC"}.}

\item{debug}{optional integer to control debugging, with positive values
indicating to print information about the processing.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements: \code{filename}, a vector of file names, and
\code{startTime}, a vector of \code{\link[=POSIXct]{POSIXct()}} times indicating the (real)
times of the first datum in the corresponding files.
}
\description{
Decode table-of-contents file from a rsk file, of the sort used by some
researchers at Dalhousie University.
}
\details{
It is assumed that the \code{.TBL} file contains lines of the form \code{"File
  \\day179\\SL08A179.023 started at Fri Jun 27 22:00:00 2008"} The first step is
to parse these lines to get day and hour information, i.e.  179 and 023 in the
line above.  Then, recognizing that it is common to change the names of such
files, the rest of the file-name information in the line is ignored, and instead
a new file name is constructed based on the data files that are found in the
directory.  (In other words, the \code{"\\\\day179\\\\SL08A"} portion of the line is
replaced.)  Once the file list is complete, with all times put into R format,
then (optionally) the list is trimmed to the time interval indicated by
\code{from} and \code{to}.  It is important that \code{from} and \code{to} be in
the \code{UTC} time zone, because that time zone is used in decoding the lines
in the \code{.TBL} file.

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{adv} object, i.e. one inheriting from \code{\link{adv-class}}.}

\item{which}{List of desired plot types.  These are graphed in panels running
down from the top of the page.  See \dQuote{Details} for the meanings of
various values of \code{which}.}

\item{col}{Optional indication of colour(s) to use.  If not provided, the
default for images is \code{oce.colorsPalette(128,1)}, and for lines and points
is black.}

\item{titles}{Optional vector of character strings to be used as labels for the
plot panels.  For images, these strings will be placed in the right hand side
of the top margin.  For timeseries, these strings are ignored.  If this is
provided, its length must equal that of \code{which}.}

\item{type}{Type of plot, as for \code{\link{plot}}.}

\item{lwd}{If the plot is of a time-series or scattergraph format with lines,
this is used in the usual way; otherwise, e.g. for image formats, this is
ignored.}

\item{drawTimeRange}{Boolean that applies to panels with time as the horizontal
axis, indicating whether to draw the time range in the top-left margin of the
plot.}

\item{drawZeroLine}{Logical value indicating whether to draw zero lines on
velocities.}

\item{useSmoothScatter}{Logical value indicating whether to use
\code{\link{smoothScatter}} in various plots, such as \code{which="uv"}.  If
not provided a default is used, with \code{\link{smoothScatter}} being used if
there are more than 2000 points to plot.}

\item{mgp}{3-element numerical
vector to use for \code{par(mgp)}, and also for \code{par(mar)}, computed from
this.  The default is tighter than the R default, in order to use more space
for the data and less for the axes.}

\item{mar}{Value to be used with \code{\link{par}("mar")}.}

\item{tformat}{Optional argument passed to \code{\link{oce.plot.ts}}, for plot
types that call that function.  (See \code{\link{strptime}} for the format
used.)}

\item{marginsAsImage}{Logical value indicating whether to put a wide margin to
the right of time-series plots, matching the space used up by a palette in an
\code{\link{imagep}} plot.}

\item{cex}{Size of labels on axes; see \code{\link[graphics]{par}}("cex").}

\item{cex.axis}{See \code{\link[graphics]{par}}("cex.axis").}

\item{cex.main}{See \code{\link[graphics]{par}}("cex.main").}

\item{xlim}{Optional 2-element list for \code{xlim}, or 2-column matrix, in
which case the rows are used, in order, for the panels of the graph.}

\item{ylim}{Optional 2-element list for \code{ylim}, or 2-column matrix, in
which case the rows are used, in order, for the panels of the graph.}

\item{brushCorrelation}{Optional number between 0 and 100, indicating a
per-beam correlation threshhold below which data are to be considered suspect.
If the plot type is \code{p}, the suspect points (velocity, backscatter
amplitude, or correlation) will be coloured red; otherwise, this argument is
ignored.}

\item{colBrush}{Colour to use for brushed (bad) data, if
\code{brushCorrelation} is active.}

\item{main}{Main title for plot, used just on the top panel, if there are
several panels.}

\item{debug}{A flag that turns on debugging.  Set to 1 to get a moderate amount
of debugging information, or to 2 to get more.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments passed to plotting functions.}

\description{
Plot ADV data, i.e. stored in an \code{\link{adv-class}} object.
}
\details{
Creates a multi-panel summary plot of data measured by an ADV.
The panels are controlled by the \code{which} argument.  (Note the
gaps in the sequence, e.g. 4 and 8 are not used.)

\itemize{
    \item \code{which=1} to \code{3} (or \code{"u1"} to \code{"u3"})

    yield timeseries of the first, second, and third components of
    velocity (in beam, xyz or enu coordinates).

    \item \code{which=4} is not permitted (since ADV are 3-beam devices)

    \item \code{which=5} to \code{7} (or \code{"a1"} to \code{"a3"})
    yield timeseries of the amplitudes of beams 1 to 3.  (Note that
    the data are called \code{data$a[,1]}, \code{data$a[,2]} and
    \code{data$a[,3]}, for these three timeseries.)

    \item \code{which=8} is not permitted (since ADV are 3-beam devices)

    \item \code{which=9} to \code{11} (or \code{"q1"} to \code{"q3"})
    yield timeseries of correlation for beams 1 to 3.  (Note that the
    data are called \code{data$c[,1]}, \code{data$c[,2]} and
    \code{data$c[,3]}, for these three timeseries.)

    \item \code{which=12} is not permitted (since ADVs are 3-beam devices)

    \item \code{which=13} is not permitted (since ADVs do not measure salinity)

    \item \code{which=14} or \code{which="temperature"} yields a timeseries of temperature.

    \item \code{which=15} or \code{which="pressure"} yields a timeseries of pressure.

    \item \code{which=16} or \code{which="heading"} yields a timeseries of heading.

    \item \code{which=17} or \code{which="pitch"}yields a timeseries of pitch.

    \item \code{which=18} or \code{which="roll"}yields a timeseries of roll.

    \item \code{which=19} to \code{21} yields plots of correlation versus
    amplitude, for beams 1 through 3, using \code{\link{smoothScatter}}.

    \item \code{which=22} is not permitted (since ADVs are 3-beam devices)

    \item \code{which=23} or \code{"progressive vector"} yields a
    progressive-vector diagram in the horizontal plane, plotted with
    \code{asp=1}, and taking beam1 and beam2 as the eastward and
    northward components of velocity, respectively.

    \item \code{which=28} or \code{"uv"} yields velocity plot in the
    horizontal plane, i.e. u[2] versus u[1].  If the number of data
    points is small, a scattergraph is used, but if it is large,
    \code{\link{smoothScatter}} is used.

    \item \code{which=29} or \code{"uv+ellipse"} as the \code{"uv"}
    case, but with an added indication of the tidal ellipse,
    calculated from the eigen vectors of the covariance matrix.

    \item \code{which=30} or \code{"uv+ellipse+arrow"} as the
    \code{"uv+ellipse"} case, but with an added arrow indicating the
    mean current.

    \item \code{which=50} or \code{"analog1"} plots a time series of the
    analog1 signal, if there is one.

    \item \code{which=51} or \code{"analog2"} plots a time series of the
    analog2 signal, if there is one.

    \item \code{which=100} or \code{"voltage"} plots the voltage as a
    timeseries, if voltage exists in the dataset.
}
In addition to the above, there are some groupings defined:
\itemize{
    \item \code{which="velocity"} equivalent to \code{which=1:3} (three velocity components)
    \item \code{which="amplitude"} equivalent to \code{which=5:7} (three amplitude components)
    \item \code{which="backscatter"} equivalent to \code{which=9:11} (three backscatter components)
    \item \code{which="hydrography"} equivalent to \code{which=14:15} (temperature and pressure)
    \item \code{which="angles"} equivalent to \code{which=16:18} (heading, pitch and roll)
}

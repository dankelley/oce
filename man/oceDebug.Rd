\title{Print a Debugging Message}
\usage{
oceDebug(debug = 0, ..., style = "plain", unindent = 0, sep = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{debug}{an integer, less than or equal to zero for no message, and
greater than zero for increasing levels of debugging.  Values greater than 4
are treated like 4.}

\item{\dots}{items to be supplied to \code{\link[=cat]{cat()}}, which does the
printing.  Note that no newline will be printed unless \dots
contains a string with a newline character (as in the example).}

\item{style}{either a string or a function. If a string,
it must be \code{"plain"} (the default) for plain text,
\code{"bold"}, \code{"italic"}, \code{"red"}, \code{"green"} or \code{"blue"} (with
obvious meanings).  Note that none of these has any effect
for non-interactive use, because doing so would make it difficult
to work with R-markdown and similar documents that are to be run
through latex.

If \code{style} is a function, it must prepend and postpend the text
with control codes, as in the cyan-coloured example; note that
\CRANpkg{crayon} provides many functions that work well for \code{style}.}

\item{unindent}{integer giving the number of levels to un-indent,
e.g. for start and end lines from a called function.}

\item{sep}{character to insert between elements of \code{...}, by passing
it to \code{\link[=cat]{cat()}}.}
}
\description{
Print an indented debugging message.
Many oce functions decrease the \code{debug} level by 1 when they call other
functions, so the effect is a nesting, with more space for deeper function
level.

\examples{
oceDebug(debug = 1, "Example", 1, "Plain text")
oceDebug(debug = 1, "Example", 2, "Bold", style = "bold")
oceDebug(debug = 1, "Example", 3, "Italic", style = "italic")
oceDebug(debug = 1, "Example", 4, "Red", style = "red")
oceDebug(debug = 1, "Example", 5, "Green", style = "green")
oceDebug(debug = 1, "Example", 6, "Blue", style = "blue")
mycyan <- function(...) paste("\033[36m", paste(..., sep = " "), "\033[0m", sep = "")
oceDebug(debug = 1, "Example", 7, "User-set cyan", style = mycyan)

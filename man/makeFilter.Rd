\usage{
makeFilter(
  type = c("blackman-harris", "rectangular", "hamming", "hann"),
  m,
  asKernel = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{a string indicating the type of filter to use.  (See Harris
(1978) for a comparison of these and similar filters.)
\itemize{
\item \code{"blackman-harris"} yields a modified raised-cosine filter designated
as "4-Term (-92 dB) Blackman-Harris" by Harris (1978; coefficients given in
the table on page 65).  This is also called "minimum 4-sample Blackman
Harris" by that author, in his Table 1, which lists figures of merit as
follows: highest side lobe level -92dB; side lobe fall off -6 db/octave;
coherent gain 0.36; equivalent noise bandwidth 2.00 bins; 3.0-dB bandwidth
1.90 bins; scallop loss 0.83 dB; worst case process loss 3.85 dB; 6.0-db
bandwidth 2.72 bins; overlap correlation 46 percent for 75\\% overlap and 3.8
for 50\\% overlap.  Note that the equivalent noise bandwidth is the width of
a spectral peak, so that a value of 2 indicates a cutoff frequency of
\code{1/m}, where \code{m} is as given below.
\item \code{"rectangular"} for a flat filter.  (This is just for convenience.  Note that
\code{\link{kernel}}\verb{("daniell",....)} gives the same result, in kernel form.)
\code{"hamming"} for a Hamming filter (a raised-cosine that does not taper
to zero at the ends)
\item \code{"hann"} (a raised cosine that tapers to zero at the ends).
}}

\item{m}{length of filter.  This should be an odd number, for any
non-rectangular filter.}

\item{asKernel}{boolean, set to \code{TRUE} to get a smoothing kernel for
the return value.}
}
\value{
If \code{asKernel} is \code{FALSE}, this returns a list of filter
coefficients, symmetric about the midpoint and summing to 1.  These may be
used with \code{\link[=filter]{filter()}}, which should be provided with argument
\code{circular=TRUE} to avoid phase offsets.  If \code{asKernel} is
\code{TRUE}, the return value is a smoothing kernel, which can be applied to
a timeseries with \code{\link[=kernapply]{kernapply()}}, whose bandwidth can be determined
with \code{\link[=bandwidth.kernel]{bandwidth.kernel()}}, and which has both print and plot
methods.
}
\description{
The filter is suitable for use by \code{\link[=filter]{filter()}},
\code{\link[=convolve]{convolve()}} or (for the \code{asKernal=TRUE} case) with
\code{\link[=kernapply]{kernapply()}}.  Note that \code{\link[=convolve]{convolve()}} should be faster
than \code{\link[=filter]{filter()}}, but it cannot be used if the time series has
missing values.  For the Blackman-Harris filter, the half-power frequency is
at \code{1/m} cycles per time unit, as shown in the \dQuote{Examples}
section.  When using \code{\link[=filter]{filter()}} or \code{\link[=kernapply]{kernapply()}} with
these filters, use \code{circular=TRUE}.

\usage{
as.sealevel(
  elevation,
  time,
  header = NULL,
  stationNumber = NA,

}
\arguments{
\item{elevation}{a list of sea-level heights in metres, in an hourly
sequence.}

\item{time}{optional list of times, in POSIXct format.  If missing, the list
will be constructed assuming hourly samples, starting at 0000-01-01
00:00:00.}

\item{header}{a character string as read from first line of a standard data
file.}

\item{stationNumber}{three-character string giving station number.}

\item{stationVersion}{single character for version of station.}

\item{stationName}{the name of station (at most 18 characters).}

\item{region}{the name of the region or country of station (at most 19
characters).}

\item{year}{the year of observation.}

\item{longitude}{the longitude in decimal degrees, positive east of
Greenwich.}

\item{latitude}{the latitude in decimal degrees, positive north of the
equator.}

\item{GMTOffset}{offset from GMT, in hours.}

\item{decimationMethod}{a coded value, with 1 meaning filtered, 2 meaning a
simple average of all samples, 3 meaning spot readings, and 4 meaning some
other method.}

\item{referenceOffset}{?}

\item{referenceCode}{?}

\item{deltat}{optional interval between samples, in hours (as for the
\code{\link[=ts]{ts()}} timeseries function). If this is not provided, and \code{t}
can be understood as a time, then the difference between the first two times
is used.  If this is not provided, and \code{t} cannot be understood as a
time, then 1 hour is assumed.}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{sealevel} object (for details, see \code{\link[=read.sealevel]{read.sealevel()}}).
}
\description{
Coerces a dataset (minimally, a sequence of times and heights) into a
sealevel dataset.
The arguments are based on the standard data format, as were described in a
file formerly available at reference 1.

\examples{
library(oce)

# Construct a year of M2 tide, starting at the default time
# 0000-01-01T00:00:00.
h <- seq(0, 24 * 365)
elevation <- 2.0 * sin(2 * pi * h / 12.4172)
sl <- as.sealevel(elevation)
summary(sl)

# As above, but start at the Y2K time.
time <- as.POSIXct("2000-01-01") + h * 3600
sl <- as.sealevel(elevation, time)
summary(sl)

The documentation for the \linkS4class{sealevel} class explains the
structure of sealevel objects, and also outlines the other functions dealing
with them.

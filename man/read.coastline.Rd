\code{"shapefile"} or \code{"openstreetmap"}.}

\item{encoding}{a character value that indicates the encoding to be used for
this data file, if it is textual.  The default value for most functions is
\code{"latin1"}, which seems to be suitable for files containing text written in
English and French.}

for reading "shapefile" type)}

\item{debug}{set to TRUE to print information about the header, etc.}

\item{processingLog}{if provided, the action item to be stored in the log.

better for normal calls by a user.)}

\description{
Read a coastline file in R, Splus, mapgen, shapefile, or openstreetmap
format.
The S and R formats are identical, and consist of two columns, lon and lat,
with land-jump segments separated by lines with two NAs.
The MapGen format is of the form \preformatted{ # -b -16.179081 28.553943
-16.244793 28.563330 } BUG: the 'arc/info ungenerate' format is not yet
understood.

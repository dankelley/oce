\usage{
as.rsk(
  time,
  columns,
  filename = "",
  instrumentType = "rbr",
  serialNumber = "",
  model = "",
  sampleInterval = NA,
  debug = getOption("oceDebug")

}
\arguments{
\item{time}{a vector of times for the data.}

\item{columns}{a list or data frame containing the measurements at the indicated
times; see \dQuote{Details}.}

\item{filename}{optional name of file containing the data.}

\item{instrumentType}{type of instrument.}

\item{serialNumber}{serial number for instrument.}

\item{model}{instrument model type, e.g. \code{"RBRduo"}.}

\item{sampleInterval}{sampling interval. If given as \code{NA}, then this is
estimated as the median difference in times.}

\item{debug}{a flag that can be set to \code{TRUE} to turn on debugging.}
}
\value{
An \linkS4class{rsk} object.
}
\description{
Create a rsk object.
}
\details{
The contents of \code{columns} are be copied into the \code{data} slot
of the returned object directly, so it is critical that the names and units
correspond to those expected by other code dealing with
\linkS4class{rsk} objects. If there is a conductivity, it must be called
\code{conductivity}, and it must be in units of mS/cm. If there is a
temperature, it must be called \code{temperature}, and it must be an in-situ
value recorded in ITS-90 units.  And if there is a pressure, it must be
\emph{absolute} pressure (sea pressure plus atmospheric pressure) and it must
be named \code{pressure}. No checks are made within \code{as.rsk} on any of
these rules, but if they are broken, you may expect problems with any further
processing.

\title{Class to store hydrographic data}

\description{Class to store hydrographic data such as measured with a CTD
    (conductivity, temperature, depth) instrument.}

\section{Methods}{

    Consider an object named \code{ctd}.

    \emph{Accessing metadata.}
  
    Metadata (contained in the S4 slot named \code{metadata}) may be retrieved
    or set by name, \code{ctd[["longitude"]] <- ctd[["longitude"]] + 1}
    corrects a one-degree error.

    \emph{Accessing measured data.}

    Column data may be accessed by name, e.g. \code{ctd[["salinity"]]},
    \code{ctd[["temperature"]]}, \code{ctd[["pressure"]]}, etc.  The TEOS-10
    notation for these quantities also works, with \code{ctd[["SP"]]},
    \code{ctd[["t"]]} and \code{ctd[["p"]]} returning identical values to those
    returned for the longer names.  (FIXME: GSW "t" should be T in ITS-90, but
    "temperature" will be whatever happens to be in the datafile, which could
    be IPTS-68 or ITS-90. Maybe there should be methods for "ITS-90" etc. This
    needs to be adjusted in code and documentation.) After these names have
    been checked, the remaining names in the \code{data} slot are checked using
    \code{\link{pmatch}}, so that e.g. \code{ctd[["sal"]]} will recover
    practical \code{salinity}, \code{ctd[["sc"]]} will recover \code{scan} (if
    it exists), etc.

    \emph{Accessing derived data.}

    Depth is accessed with e.g. \code{ctd[["depth"]]}, while its negative, the
    vertical coordinate, is accessed with e.g.  \code{ctd[["z"]]}; note that
    these are calculated using \code{\link{swDepth}} and \code{\link{swZ}}, and
    that any values that may have been read in a data file are ignored. 
    
    Potential temperature defined according to UNESCO-1980 is calculated with
    \code{ctd[["theta"]]} or \code{ctd[["potential temperature"]]}.  Salinity
    is retrieved with \code{ctd[["S"]]} or \code{ctd[["salinity"]]}.

    Conservative Temperature defined according to TEOS-2010 is calculated with
    \code{ctd[["CT"]]} or \code{ctd[["conservative temperature"]]}.  Absolute
    salinity is calculated with \code{ctd[["SA"]]} or \code{ctd[["absolute
        salinity"]]}. Note that the salinity calculation requires a latitude
    and longitude, and if the \code{ctd} object lacks those data, the values
    300E and 30N will be used as a default.
    
    The square of buoyancy frequency is retrieved with \code{ctd[["N2"]]} or
    \code{\link{swN2}}, density ratio with \code{ctd[["Rrho"]]} and spiciness
    with \code{ctd[["spice"]]}.

    \emph{Assigning values.}
   
    Items stored in the object may be altered with e.g.
    \code{ctd[["salinity"]] <- rep(35,10)}.  For obvious reasons, this does not
    work with derived quantities such as conservative temperature, etc.

    \emph{Overview of contents.}
   
    The \code{show} method (e.g.  \code{show(ctd)}) displays information about
    the object.

\seealso{A file containing CTD profile data may be read with
    \code{\link{read.ctd}}, and a CTD object can also be created with
    \code{\link{as.ctd}}.  See \code{\link{read.ctd}} for references on data
    formats used in CTD files.
  
    Statistical summaries are provided by \code{\link{summary.ctd}}, while
    \code{\link{show}} displays an overview.
  
    CTD objects may be plotted with \code{\link{plot.ctd}}, which does much of
    its work by calling \code{\link{plotProfile}} or \code{\link{plotTS}}, both
    of which can also be called by the user, to get fine control over the
    plots.

    A CTD profile can be isolated from a larger record with
    \code{\link{ctdTrim}}, a task made easier when \code{\link{plotScan}} is
    used to examine the results.  Towyow data can be split up into sets of
    profiles (ascending or descending) with \code{\link{ctdFindProfiles}}.  CTD
    data may be smoothed and/or cast onto specified pressure levels with
    \code{\link{ctdDecimate}}.  
  
    Low-level manipulation may be done with functions such as
    \code{\link{ctdAddColumn}} and \code{\link{ctdUpdateHeader}}.
    Additionally, many of the contents of CTD objects may be altered with the
    \code{[[]]} scheme discussed above, and skilled users may also manipulate
    the contents directly.

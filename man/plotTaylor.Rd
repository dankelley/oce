\title{Plot a Model-data Comparison Diagram}
\usage{
plotTaylor(x, y, scale, pch, col, labels, pos, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of reference values of some quantity, e.g. measured over
time or space.}

\item{y}{a matrix whose columns hold values of values to be compared with
those in x.  (If \code{y} is a vector, it is converted first to a one-column
matrix).}

\item{scale}{optional scale, interpreted as the maximum value of standard
deviation.}

\item{pch}{list of characters to plot, one for each column of \code{y}.}

\item{col}{list of colors for points on the plot, one for each column of
\code{y}.}

\item{labels}{optional vector of strings to use for labelling the points.}

\item{pos}{optional vector of positions for labelling strings.  If not
provided, labels will be to the left of the symbols.}

\item{\dots}{optional arguments passed by \code{plotTaylor} to more child
functions.}
}
\description{
Creates a diagram as described by Taylor (2001).  The graph is in the form
of a semicircle, with radial lines and spokes connecting at a focus point on
the flat (lower) edge.  The radius of a point on the graph indicates the
standard deviation of the corresponding quantity, i.e. x and the columns in
y.  The angle connecting a point on the graph to the focus provides an
indication of correlation coefficient with respect to x.  The ``east'' side
of the graph indicates \eqn{R=1}{R=1}, while \eqn{R=0}{R=0} is at the
"north" edge and \eqn{R=-1}{R=-1} is at the "west" side.  The \code{x}
data are indicated with a bullet on the graph, appearing on the lower edge
to the right of the focus at a distance indicating the standard deviation of
`x`.  The other points on the graph represent the columns of `y`,
coded automatically or with the supplied values of `pch` and
`col`.
The example shows two tidal models of the Halifax sealevel data, computed
with \code{\link[=tidem]{tidem()}} with just the M2 component and the S2 component;
the graph indicates that the M2 model is much better than the S2 model.

library(oce)
data(sealevel)
x <- sealevel[["elevation"]]
M2 <- predict(tidem(sealevel, constituents = "M2"))
S2 <- predict(tidem(sealevel, constituents = c("S2")))
plotTaylor(x, cbind(M2, S2))

\title{Plot a Model-data Comparison Diagram}
\usage{
plotTaylor(x, y, scale, pch = 1, col = 1, labels, pos = 2, cex = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of reference values of some quantity, e.g.
measured over time or space.}

\item{y}{a matrix whose columns hold values of values to be
compared with those in x.  (If \code{y} is a vector, it is converted
first to a one-column matrix).}

\item{scale}{optional scale, interpreted as the maximum value of
the standard deviation.}

\item{pch}{vector of plot symbols, used for points on the plot. If
this is of length less than the number of columns in \code{y}, then it
it is repeated as needed to match those columns.}

\item{col}{vector of colors for points on the plot, repeated as
necessary (see \code{pch}).}

\item{labels}{optional vector of strings to use for labelling the
points.}

\item{pos}{optional vector of positions for labelling strings,
repeated as necessary (see \code{pch}).}

\item{cex}{character expansion factor, repeated if necessary
(see \code{pch}).}
}
\description{
Creates a diagram as described by Taylor (2001).  The graph is in
the form of a semicircle, with radial lines and spokes connecting
at a focus point on the flat (lower) edge.  The radius of a point
on the graph indicates the standard deviation of the corresponding
quantity, i.e. x and the columns in y.  The angle connecting a
point on the graph to the focus provides an indication of
correlation coefficient with respect to x.
}
\details{
The ``east'' side of the graph indicates \eqn{R=1}{R=1}, while
\eqn{R=0}{R=0} is at the "north" edge and \eqn{R=-1}{R=-1} is at
the "west" side.  The \code{x} data are indicated with a bullet on the
graph, appearing on the lower edge to the right of the focus at a
distance indicating the standard deviation of `x`.  The other
points on the graph represent the columns of `y`, coded
automatically or with the supplied values of `pch` and `col`. The
example shows three tidal models of the Halifax sealevel data,
computed with \code{\link[=tidem]{tidem()}} with only the M2 component, only the S2
component, or all (auto-selected) components.
}
\examples{
library(oce)
data(sealevel)
x <- sealevel[["elevation"]]
M2 <- predict(tidem(sealevel, constituents = "M2"))
S2 <- predict(tidem(sealevel, constituents = "S2"))
all <- predict(tidem(sealevel))
plotTaylor(x, cbind(M2, S2, all), labels = c("M2", "S2", "all"))

\title{Read Nortek Aquadopp file}
\usage{
read.aquadopp(file, from = 1, to, by = 1, tz = getOption("oceTz"),
  longitude = NA, latitude = NA, orientation, distance, monitor = FALSE,
  despike = FALSE, processingLog, debug = getOption("oceDebug"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{a connection or a character string giving the name of the file
to load.  (For \code{read.adp.sontek.serial}, this is generally a list of
files, which will be concatenated.}

\item{from}{indication of the first profile to read.  This can be an
integer, the sequence number of the first profile to read, or a POSIXt time
before which profiles should be skipped, or a character string that converts
to a POSIXt time (assuming UTC timezone).  See \dQuote{Examples}, and make
careful note of the use of the \code{tz} argument.}

\item{to}{if supplied, an indication of the last profile to read, in a
format as described for \code{from}.  If not supplied, the whole file will
be read.}

\item{by}{an indication of the stride length to use while walking through
the file.  If this is an integer, then \code{by-1} profiles are skipped
between each pair of profiles that is read.  If this is a string
representing a time interval, in colon-separated format (MM:SS), then this
interval is divided by the sampling interval, to get the stride length.}

\item{tz}{character string indicating time zone to be assumed in the data.}

\item{longitude}{optional signed number indicating the longitude in degrees
East.}

\item{latitude}{optional signed number indicating the latitude in degrees
North.}

\item{orientation}{Optional character string specifying the orientation of the
sensor, provided for those cases in which it cannot be inferred from the
data file.  The valid choices are \code{"upward"}, \code{"downward"}, and
\code{"sideward"}.}

\item{distance}{Optional vector holding the distances of bin centres from the
sensor.  This argument is ignored except for Nortek profilers, and need not
be given if the function determines the distances correctly from the data.
The problem is that the distance is poorly documented in the Nortek System
Integrator Guide (2008 edition, page 31), so the function must rely on
word-of-mouth formulae that do not work in all cases.}

\item{monitor}{boolean, set to \code{TRUE} to provide an indication (with
numbers and dots) of every profile read.}

\item{despike}{if \code{TRUE}, \code{\link{despike}} will be used to clean
anomalous spikes in heading, etc.}

\item{processingLog}{if provided, the action item to be stored in the log.
(Typically only provided for internal calls; the default that it provides is
better for normal calls by a user.)}

\item{debug}{a flag that turns on debugging.  Set to 1 to get a moderate
amount of debugging information, or to 2 to get more.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments, passed to called routines.}
}
\value{
An \code{adp} object, i.e. one inheriting from \code{\link{adp-class}}.

\description{
The R code is based on information in
the Nortek System Integrator Guide (2008) and on postings on the Nortek
``knowledge center'' discussion board.  One might assume that the latter is
less authoritative than the former.  For example, the inference of cell size
follows advice found at
\url{http://www.nortekusa.com/en/knowledge-center/forum/hr-profilers/736804717}
(downloaded June 2012), which contains a typo in an early posting that is
corrected later on.

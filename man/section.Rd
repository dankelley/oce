data(section)
}
\description{
This is line A03 (ExpoCode 90CT40_1, with nominal sampling date 1993-09-11).
The chief scientist was Tereschenkov of SOI, working aboard the Russian ship
Multanovsky, undertaking a westward transect from the Mediterranean outflow
region across to North America, with a change of heading in the last few dozen
stations to run across the nominal Gulf Stream axis.
The data flags follow the "WHP Bottle"convention, set by
\code{\link[=initializeFlagScheme,section-method]{initializeFlagScheme,section-method()}} to \code{"WHP bottle"}.  This convention
used to be described at the link
\verb{https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/woce/woce_v3/wocedata_1/whp/exchange/exchange_format_desc.htm}
but that was found to fail in December 2020.

\section{Speculation on a timing error}{

In May 2022, it was discovered that the times in this dataset are not fully
sequential, at two spots.  This might be a reporting error. Station 41 has
time listed as 1993-10-03T00:06:00 and that leads to a time reversal.
However, if that time were actually on the day before, then
the time reversal would vanish, and the inter-station timing of
about 5 to 6 hours would be recovered. A similar pattern is seen at station
45.  Of course, this hypothesis of incorrect recording is difficult to test,
for data taken thirty years ago.

library(oce)
# Gulf Stream
data(section)
GS <- subset(section, 113 <= stationId & stationId <= 129)
GSg <- sectionGrid(GS, p = seq(0, 5000, 100))
plot(GSg, span = 1500) # increase span to show more coastline

\usage{
interpBarnes(
  x,
  y,
  z,
  w,
  xg,
  yg,
  xgl,
  ygl,
  xr,
  yr,
  gamma = 0.5,
  iterations = 2,
  trim = 0,
  pregrid = FALSE,
  debug = getOption("oceDebug")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{a vector of x and y locations.}

\item{z}{a vector of z values, one at each (x,y) location.}

\item{w}{a optional vector of weights at the (x,y) location.  If not
supplied, then a weight of 1 is used for each point, which means equal
weighting.  Higher weights give data points more influence. If \code{pregrid}
is \code{TRUE}, then any supplied value of \code{w} is ignored, and instead
each of the pregriddd points is given equal weight.}

\item{xg, yg}{optional vectors defining the x and y grids.  If not supplied,
these values are inferred from the data, using e.g. \code{pretty(x, n=50)}.}

\item{xgl, ygl}{optional lengths of the x and y grids, to be constructed with
\code{\link[=seq]{seq()}} spanning the data range.  These values \code{xgl} are only
examined if \code{xg} and \code{yg} are not supplied.}

\item{xr, yr}{optional values defining the x and y radii of the weighting ellipse.
If not supplied, these are calculated as the span of x
and y over the square root of the number of data.}

\item{gamma}{grid-focussing parameter.  At each successive iteration, \code{xr} and
\code{yr} are reduced by a factor of \code{sqrt(gamma)}.}

\item{iterations}{number of iterations.  Set this to 1 to perform just
one iteration, using the radii as described at \verb{xr,yr} above.}

\item{trim}{a number between 0 and 1, indicating the quantile of data weight
to be used as a criterion for blanking out the gridded value (using
\code{NA}).  If 0, the whole \code{zg} grid is returned.  If >0, any spots
on the grid where the data weight is less than the \code{trim}-th
\code{\link[=quantile]{quantile()}} are set to \code{NA}.  See examples.}

\item{pregrid}{an indication of whether to pre-grid the data. If
\code{FALSE}, this is not done, i.e. conventional Barnes interpolation is
performed.  Otherwise, then the data are first averaged within grid cells
using \code{\link[=binMean2D]{binMean2D()}}.  If \code{pregrid} is \code{TRUE} or
\code{4}, then this averaging is done within a grid that is 4 times finer
than the grid that will be used for the Barnes interpolation. Otherwise,
\code{pregrid} may be a single integer indicating the grid refinement (4
being the result if \code{TRUE} had been supplied), or a vector of two
integers, for the grid refinement in x and y. The purpose of using
\code{pregrid} is to speed processing on large datasets, and to remove
spatial bias (e.g. with a single station that is repeated frequently in an
otherwise seldom-sampled region).  A form of pregridding is done in the
World Ocean Atlas, for example.}

\item{debug}{a flag that turns on debugging.  Set to 0 for no debugging
information, to 1 for more, etc; the value is reduced by 1 for each
descendent function call.}
}
\value{
A list containing: \code{xg}, a vector holding the x-grid);
\code{yg}, a vector holding the y-grid; \code{zg}, a matrix holding the
gridded values; \code{wg}, a matrix holding the weights used in the
interpolation at its final iteration; and \code{zd}, a vector of the same
length as \code{x}, which holds the interpolated values at the data points.
}
\description{
The algorithm follows that described by Koch et al. (1983), except
that \code{interpBarnes} adds (1) the ability to
blank out the grid where data are
sparse, using the \code{trim} argument, and (2) the ability to
pre-grid, with the \code{pregrid} argument.

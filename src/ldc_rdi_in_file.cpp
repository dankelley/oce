Locate Data Chunk for RDI

@description

Read an RDI adp file, finding the start indices of ensembles (or
"profiles", in other words).  Use `from` and `to` to extract a subset
of the file.  Setting `from=1` and `to=0` means to read the entire
file.

@details

In the name, "ldc" refers to "Locate Data Chunk", and "rdi" refers to
RD Instruments.

@section history:

A version of this function, used before October 2016, was passed a
buffer that contained the whole file contents. This scheme was dropped
because of limitations on the size of vectors in R, which is set by
the R use of 32-bit integers. (Note: 2^32-1 corresponds to a data file
of roughly 4.3Gb.)

THIS IS A FUNCTION STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, and much of what is said
about the behaviour is aspirational. At present, it reads the *whole*
file, ignoring all arguments except the file name.

@param filename character string indicating the name of an RDI adp
file.

@param from integer giving the index of the first ensemble (AKA
profile) to retrieve. The R notation is used, i.e. from=1 means the
first profile.

@param to integer giving the index of the last ensemble to retrieve.
As a special case, setting this to 0 will retrieve *all* the data
within the file.

@param by integer giving increment of the sequence, as for seq(), i.e.
a value of 1 means to retrieve all the profiles, while a value of 2
means to get every second profile.

@param mode integer, 0 if 'from' etc are profile numbers or 1 if they
are the numerical values of unix times.

@value a list containing "ensembleStart", "time", "sec100", and
"buf", which are used in the calling R function, read.adp.rdi().

@examples

R CMD SHLIB ldc_rdi_in_file.c
f <- "/data/archive/sleiwex/2008/moorings/m09/adp/rdi_2615/raw/adp_rdi_2615.000"
dyn.load("src/ldc_rdi_in_file.so")
a <- .Call("ldc_rdi_in_file", f, 1, 0, 1) # whole file
b <- .Call("ldc_rdi_in_file", f, 1, 10, ) # first 10 ensembles
stopifnot(all.equal(length(a$ensembleStart), 79134))
stopifnot(all.equal(a$ensembleStart[1:10], b$ensembleStart))

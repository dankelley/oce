Instructions: please remove these sentences, replacing them with (1) a sentence or two describing the issue, (2) a pared-down code example, and (3) the output from `sessionInfo()`. An ideal way to prepare your code is to use the `reprex` function from the `reprex` package (see https://dankelley.github.io/dek_blog/2024/03/06/reprex.html for how to use `reprex`). If your code needs data, please attach relevant files to your comment, or, if the data are private, email the files to the developers (kelley.dan@gmail.com and clark.richards@gmail.com), who will respect your privacy.

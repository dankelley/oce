**Abstract.** The `oce` package makes it easy to read, summarize and plot data
from a variety of Oceanographic instruments, isolating the researcher from the
quirky data formats that are common in this field. It also provides functions
for working with basic seawater properties such as the equation of state, and
with derived quantities such as the buoyancy frequency.  Although simple enough
to be used in a teaching context, `oce` is powerful enough for a research
setting.  These things are illustrated here in a practical context.  Worked
exercises are provided to help readers take early steps towards using the `oce`
package in their research.

## 1. Introduction

Oceanographers must deal with measurements made by a wide variety of
instruments, a task that is complicated by a tendency of instrument
manufacturers to invent new data formats. Although manufacturers often provide
software for scanning data files and producing overview plots, this software is
of limited use to researchers who work with several instrument types at the
same time, and who need to move beyond engineering plots to scientific plots
and statistical analysis.

## 2. Object design and generic functions

![**Figure 1.** Basic layout of a CTD object.  All `oce` objects contain slots named `data`, `metadata`, and `processingLog`, with the contents depending on the type of data.](ctd-object.png)

The need to scan diverse data files was one motivation for the creation of
`oce`, but an equal goal was to make it easy to work with the data once they
are in the system.  This was accomplished partly by the provision of
specialized and generic (overloaded) functions to work with the data, and
partly by providing accessor methods that make it convenient to reach inside
the data objects.

As illustrated in Figure 1, each `oce` object contains three slots:

* `data`, a list containing the actual data, e.g., for a CTD object, this will
  contain `pressure`, `temperature`, etc.
* `metadata`, a list containing information about the data, such as units,
  quality flags, sampling locations, etc.
* `processingLog`, a list that documents how the object was created and
  possibly changed thereafter.

The uniformity of the various `oce` objects helps users build skill in
examining and modifying objects. Fine-scale control is provided throughout
`oce`, but the best way to learn is to start with simplest tools and their
defaults.  For example, the following will read a CTD file named
`"station1.cnv"`, summarize the contents, and plot an overview of the data,
with profiles, a TS diagram, and a map (Figure 2).
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(oce)
d <- read.oce("station1.cnv")
summary(d)
plot(d)
```
The reader should stop now and try this on a file of their own. The pattern
will work with a fairly wide variety of file types, because `read.oce()` examines
the file name and contents to try to discover what it is. For an example, if
`read.oce()` is given the name of a file created by an Acoustic Doppler Profiler,
it will return an object inheriting from class `"adp"`, so the `summary()` and
`plot()` calls will be tailored to that type, e.g. the graph will show images of
time-distance variation in each of the measured velocity components.

**Notes on oce function names.**

1. As just illustrated, the general function to read a dataset ends in `.oce`,
   and the name is a signal that the returned object is of class `oce`.
   Depending on the file contents, `d` will also have an additional class, e.g.
   if the file contains CTD data, then the object would have two classes, `oce`
   and `ctd`, with the second being used to tailor the graphics by 
   passing control to `plot.ctd()`.

2. Generally, `oce` functions employ a "camel case" naming convention, in which
   a function that is described by several words is named by stringing the
   words together, capitalizing the second and subsequent words. For example,
   `ctdAddColumn()` takes a `ctd` object, and returns a new `ctd` object that
   matches the original except for the added column (and an added entry in the
   `processingLog` to indicate the addition).

3. Function names begin with `oce` in cases where a more natural name would be
   in conflict with a function in the base R system or a package commonly used
   by Oceanographers.  For example, `oceContour()` is a function that provides
   an alternative to `contour()` in the `graphics` package.

## 3. Calculation of seawater properties

The `oce` package provides many functions for dealing with seawater properties.
Perhaps the most used is `swRho(S,T,p)`, which computes seawater density
$\rho=\rho(S, T, p)$, where $S$ is salinity,  $T$ is *in-situ* temperature in
$^\circ$C (on the ITS-90 scale), and $p$ is seawater pressure, i.e. the excess
over atmospheric pressure, in dbar.  (This and similar functions starts with
the letters `sw` to designate that they relate to seawater properties.) The
result is a number in the order of $1000$kg/m$^3$.  For many purposes,
Oceanographers prefer to use the density anomaly $\sigma=\rho-1000$kg/m$^3$,
provided with `swSigma(salinity,temperature,pressure)`, or its adiabatic cousin
$\sigma_\theta$, provided with `swSigmaTheta()`.

Most of the functions can use either the UNESCO or GSW (TEOS-10) formulation of
seawater properties, with the choice set by an argument called `eos`.  It
should be noted that `oce` uses the `gsw` package for GSW calculations.
**Caution:** the results obtained with `eos="gsw"` in `oce` functions may
differ from the results obtained when using the `gsw` functions directly, due
to unit conventions. For example, `swCSTp(..., eos="gsw")` reports conductivity
ratio for consistency with the UNESCO formulation, however the underlying `gsw`
function `gsw::gsw_C_from_SP()` reports conductivity in mS/cm. 

A partial list of seawater functions is as follows:

* `swAlpha()` for thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha=-\rho_0^{-1}\partial\rho/\partial T$
* `swAlphaOverBeta()` for $\alpha/\beta$
* `swBeta()` for haline compression coefficient $\beta=\rho_0^{-1}\partial\rho/\partial S$
* `swConductivity()` for conductivity from $S$, $T$ and $p$
* `swDepth()` for depth from $p$ and latitude
* `swDynamicHeight()` for dynamic height
* `swLapseRate()` for adiabatic lapse rate
* `swN2()` for buoyancy frequency
* `swRho()` for density $\rho$ from $S$, $T$ and $p$
* `swSCTp()` for salinity from conductivity, temperature and pressure
* `swSTrho()` for salinity from temperature and density
* `swSigma()` for $\rho-1000$\,kg/m$^3$
* `swSigmaT()` for $\sigma$ with $p$ set to zero and temperature unaltered
* `swSigmaTheta()` for$\sigma$ with $p$ set to zero and temperature altered adiabatically
* `swSoundSpeed()` for speed of sound
* `swSpecificHeat()` for specific heat
* `swSpice()` for a quantity used in double-diffusive research
* `swTFreeze()` for freezing temperature
* `swTSrho()` for temperature from salinity and density
* `swTheta()` for potential temperature $\theta$
* `swViscosity()` for viscosity

Details and examples are provided in the documentation of these functions.

The following exercise may be of help to readers who prefer to learn by doing.
(Answers are provided at the end of this document.)

**Exercise 1.** a. What is the density of a seawater parcel at pressure
100 dbar, with salinity 34 PSU and temperature 10$^\circ$C?
b. What temperature would the parcel have if raised adiabatically to the surface?
c. What density would it have if raised adiabatically to the surface?
d. What density would it have if lowered about 100m, increasing the pressure to 200 dbar?
e. Draw a blank $T$-$S$ diagram with $S$ from 30 to 40 PSU and $T$ from -2 to 20$^\circ$C.



## 4. CTD data

### 4.1 Example with pre-trimmed data

Many of the object types supported by `oce` come with built-in data.  For an
example, `data(ctd)` yields a CTD profile that has been trimmed to just the
downcast portion of the sampling.  (See the next section to learn how to do
this trimming.)  A summary and plot (Figure 2) are created as follows.

```{r fig.cap="**Figure 2.** An overview of a ctd dataset.", fig.width=6, fig.height=6, dpi=72, dev.args=list(pointsize=15), message=FALSE}
library(oce)
data(ctd)
summary(ctd)
plot(ctd)
```

Accessing the data within this `ctd` object can be done directly, e.g.
`ctd@data$pressure` holds the pressure record, but it is usually better to use
an accessor function that is provided with `oce`. This function is named `[[`,
and it takes a character string as an argument, e.g. `ctd[["pressure"]]` yields
the pressure column. The accessor notation is preferable to direct access
because it is simpler for the user. For example, several `oce` objects store
the data in single-byte or two-byte chunks, to match the raw format used by the
instruments, and the accessor function takes care of translating these values
to what are sometimes called "science" units.

**Exercise 2.** Plot a profile of $\sigma_\theta$ and $N^2$, for the data in
the pycnocline. (Hint: use `subset()`.)

### 4.2 Example with raw data

Practicing Oceanographers may be wondering how the CTD cast used in the
preceding section was trimmed of equilibration-phase and upcast-phase data.
Spurious data from these phases must be trimmed as a first step in processing.
For example, consider the following code.
```{r fig.cap="**Figure 3.** Scanwise plot of the `ctdRaw` sample data set.  Note the spike at the start, the equilibration phase before the downcast, and the spurious freshening signal near the start of the upcast.", fig.width=5, fig.height=3, dpi=72, dev.args=list(pointsize=12)}
data(ctdRaw)
plotScan(ctdRaw)
```

This produces a two-panel plot (Figure 3) of the data as a time-series,
revealing not just the desired downcast, but also an earlier equilibration
phase and a later upcast.  The x-axis in Figure 3 is the scan number, which is
a convenient index for extraction of the downcast portion of the profile by an
essentially manual method, e.g. proceeding with a sequence of commands such as

```{r eval=FALSE}
plotScan(ctdTrim(ctdRaw, "range",
                 parameters=list(item="scan", from=140, to=250)))
plotScan(ctdTrim(ctdRaw, "range",
                 parameters=list(item="scan", from=150, to=250)))
```

This method of making decisions based on plotted information is probably the
most robust method of trimming data.  However, for quick work, users may be
satisfied with the results of automatic downcast detection, e.g.
```{r eval=FALSE}
ctdTrimmed <- ctdTrim(ctdRaw)
```

It should be noted that `ctdTrim()` inserts entries into the object's log file,
so that the details of how the trimming was done are recorded together with the
data.

Once the profile has been trimmed, one may wish to use `ctd.decimate()` to smooth
the data and interpolate the smoothed results to uniformly-spaced pressure
values.

Taking these things together, a quick visual examination of a CTD file takes
just one line of code:
```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(ctdDecimate(ctdTrim(read.ctd("stn123.cnv"))))
```

### 4.3 Example with WOCE archive data

The package has a harder time scanning the headers of data files in the WOCE
archive format than it does in the Seabird format illustrated in the previous
examples. This is mainly because front-line researchers tend to work in the
Seabird format, and partly because the WOCE format is odd. For example, the
first line of a WOCE file is of the form `CTD,20060609WHPOSIODAM` (or
`BOTTLE,...`).  Scanning the item to the left of the comma is not difficult
(although there are variants to the two shown, e.g. `CTDO` sometimes occurs).
The part to the right of the comma is more difficult.  The first part is a date
(`yyyymmdd`) so that is no problem.  But then things start to get tricky.  In
the example provided, this text contains the division of the institute (WHPO),
the institute itself (SIO), and initial of the investigator (DAM). The problem
is that no dividers separate these items, and that there seem to be no
standards for the item lengths. Rather than spend a great deal of time coding
special cases (e.g. scanning to see if the string `WHOI` occurs in the header
line), the approach taken with `oce` is to ignore such issues relating to
quirky headers, on the assumption that users can scan human-written headers
with high skill.

Quite commonly, CTD profiles taken during a cruise are collected together in a
sequence of files in a given directory.  For a real-world example, one might
visit the website mentioned in the code provided below, download and expand the
zip file, enter the directory thus formed, and run the code to get an overall
TS plot for all the CTD stations of this cruise. (Caution: the link seems to
change from time to time.)

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(oce)
# http://cchdo.ucsd.edu/data/7971/ar18_58JH19941029_ct1.zip
# setwd("~/Downloads/ar18_58JH19941029_ct1")
files <- system("ls *.csv", intern=TRUE)
for (i in 1:length(files)) {
    x <- read.ctd(files[i])
    if (i == 1) {
        plotTS(x, Slim=c(31, 35.5), Tlim=c(-2, 10), type='o')
    } else {
        points(x[["salinity"]], x[["potential temperature"]])
        lines(x[["salinity"]], x[["potential temperature"]])
    }
}
```

In the above, lines connect the points within a given profile. This can be a
useful method for a quick scan looking for outliers. Another is to colour-code
the profiles, although this gets confusing with large datasets, in which case
the method of the following exercise might be useful.

**Exercise 3. (advanced)** Make a multi-file plot summarizing the TS
relationship, with each file showing the overall relationship in gray and the
individual profile in black.


## 5. Section plots

The commands
```{r eval=FALSE}
data(section)
plot(section, which=c(1, 2, 3, 99))
```
will plot a summary diagram containing sections of $T$, $S$, and
$\sigma_\theta$, along with a chart indicating station locations. In addition
to such overview diagrams, `plot.section()`, which is called by `plot()`, can
also create individual plots of individual properties.

Some section datasets are supplied in a pre-gridded format, but it is also
common to have different pressure levels at each station.  For such cases,
`sectionGrid()` may be used, e.g. the following produces Figure 4. The ship was
travelling westward from the Mediterranean towards North America, taking 124
stations in total; the `stationId` value selects the last few stations of the
section, during which the ship headed toward the northwest, crossing isobaths
(and perhaps, the Gulf Stream) at nearly right angles.

```{r fig.cap="**Figure 4.** Portion of the CTD section designated A03, showing the Gulf Sream region.  The square on the cruise track corresponds to zero distance on the section.", fig.width=5, fig.height=5, dpi=72, dev.args=list(pointsize=12)}
library(oce)
data(section)
GS <- subset(section, 102 <= stationId & stationId <= 124)
GSg <- sectionGrid(GS, p=seq(0, 1600, 25))
plot(GSg, which=c(1,99), map.xlim=c(-85,-(64+13/60)))
```

**Exercise 4.** Draw a $T$-$S$ diagram for the section data, using black
symbols to the east of 30W and gray symbols to the west, thus highlighting
Mediterranean-derived waters. (Hint: use the accessor function `[[`.)

**Exercise 5.** Plot dynamic height and geostrophic velocity across the Gulf
Stream. (Hint: use the `swDynamicHeight()` function.)

## 6. Maps

### 6.1 About projections

There are several ways to handle map projections in R and other systems. Oce
uses the `rgdal` package to calculate the details of map projections.  A wide
group of functions is provided for plotting maps.  The first step is to call
`mapPlot()` to construct the map, after which points can be added with
`mapPoints()`, lines with `mapLines()`, etc. For example, the following plots a
world coastline in the Winkel Tripel projection (used by the National
Geographical Society, and so familiar to many readers), with the cruise track
for the `section` dataset in red.
```{r fig.cap="**Figure 5.** World in Winkel Tripel projection, with the `section` profile sites indicated.", fig.width=4, fig.height=2.6, dpi=72}
library(oce)
data(coastlineWorld)
par(mar=rep(0, 4))
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=wintri", col="lightgray")
data(section)
lon <- section[["longitude", "byStation"]]
lat <- section[["latitude", "byStation"]]
mapLines(lon, lat, col='red', cex=0.5)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
data(coastlineWorld)
par(mar=rep(1, 4))
```

There are far too many projections to illustrate here. See
<http://dankelley.github.io/r/2015/04/03/oce-proj.html>
for a blog item that provides examples of the available projections. Note that
some have a problem with spurious horizontal lines. This can result from
coastline segments that cross the edge of the plotting area, and getting rid of
this is tricky enough to be the heart of the longest-lived bug in the `oce`
issue list, i.e. <https://github.com/dankelley/oce/issues/388>. In some instances the function `coastlineCut()` can help, but it is provisional and subject to change.


### 6.2 Popular world-view projections

A few common projections are worth highlighting. In addition to the Winkel
Tripel projection shown in Figure 5, it is also common to employ Mollweide,
Eckert IV or Robinson for world-wide views; these are achieved as follows.

```{r fig.keep="none"}
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=moll") # Molleweide
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=eck4") # Eckert IV
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=robin") # Robinson
```

Before moving on to other projections, it may be helpful to show how to plot
gridded data with projection, using sea-surface temperature as a test case.

```{r fig.cap="**Figure 6.** World SST in Molleweide projection.", fig.width=5, fig.height=2.7, dpi=72}
par(mar=rep(1, 4))
data(levitus, package='ocedata')
lon <- levitus$longitude
lat <- levitus$latitude
SST <- levitus$SST
Tlim <- c(-2, 30)
drawPalette(Tlim, col=oce.colorsJet)
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=moll", grid=FALSE)
mapImage(lon, lat, SST, col=oce.colorsJet, zlim=Tlim)
mapPolygon(coastlineWorld, col='gray')
```

### 6.3 Popular mid-latitude projections

Mid-latitude regions are sometimes represented with Lambert Conformal Conic projection,
e.g. Figure 7 was produced as follows.
```{r fig.cap="**Figure 7.** North Atlantic in Lambert Conformal Conic projection.", fig.width=5, fig.height=3, dpi=72}
par(mar=c(2, 2, 1, 1))
lonlim <- c(-80, 0)
latlim <- c(20, 60)
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=lcc +lat_1=30 +lat_2=50 +lon_0=-40",
        longitudelim=lonlim, latitudelim=latlim)
```

Other common mid-latitude projections include Mercator and Albers Equal-Area
Conic, produced as follows.
```{r , fig.keep="none"}
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=merc",
        longitudelim=lonlim, latitudelim=latlim)
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=aea +lat_1=30 +lat_2=70 +lon_0=-40",
        longitudelim=lonlim, latitudelim=latlim)
```

### 6.4 Popular high-latitude projections

High-latitude regions are often represented with stereopolar projections, e.g.
Figure 8 was produced with the following.
```{r fig.cap="**Figure 8.** Arctic coastlines in stereopolar projection.", fig.width=5, fig.height=5, dpi=72}
par(mar=c(2, 2, 1, 1))
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=stere +lat_0=90",
        longitudelim=c(-80,0), latitudelim=c(70, 110))
```



## 7. Sea-level data

### 7.1 Time-domain analysis

The following code graphs a built-in dataset of sea-level time series (Figure
9).  The top panel provides an overview of the entire data set. The second
panel is narrowed to the most recent month, which should reveal spring-neap
cycles if the tide is mixed. The third panel is a log spectrum, with a few
tidal constituents indicated. The `plot.sealevel()` function provides other
possibilities for plotting, of which the cumulative spectrum can be quite
informative.


```{r fig.cap="**Figure 9.** Sea-level timeseries measured in 2003 in Halifax Harbour.", fig.width=7, fig.height=5, dpi=72, dev.args=list(pointsize=16)}
library(oce)
data(sealevel)
plot(sealevel)
```

**Exercise 6.** Illustrate Halifax sea-level variations during Hurricane Juan,
near the end of September, 2003.

### 7.2 Tidal-harmonic analysis

A preliminary version of tidal analysis is provided by the `tidem` function
provided in this version of the package, but readers are cautioned that the
results are certain to change in a future version.  (The problems involve
phase and the inference of satellite nodes.)

**Exercise 7.** Plot the de-tided Halifax sea level during Autumn 2003, to see
whether Hurricane Juan is visible. (Hint: use `predict` with the results from
`tidem`.)

## 8. Working with Acoustic Doppler Profiler data

The following commands produce Figure 10, showing one velocity component of
currents measured in the St Lawrence Estuary Internal Wave Experiment. This
plot type is just one of many provided by `plot.adp()`.
```{r fig.cap="**Figure 10.** Measurements made with a bottom-mounted ADP in the St Lawrence Estuary. The line near the surface indicates pressure measured by the ADP.", fig.width=5, fig.height=2, dpi=72}
library(oce)
data(adp)
plot(adp, which=1)
lines(adp[['time']], adp[['pressure']], lwd=2)
```

## 9. Working in non-English languages

Many of the `oce` plotting functions produce axis labels that can be
displayed in languages other than English.  At the time of writing, French,
German, Spanish, and Mandarin are supported in at least a rudimentary way.
Setting the language can be done at the general system level, or within R, 
as indicated below (results not shown).
```{r fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE="fr")
data(ctd)
plot(ctd)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE="en")
```

Most of the translated items were found by online dictionaries, and so they may
be incorrect for oceanographic usage.  Readers can help out in the translation
effort, if they have knowledge of how nautical words such as *Pitch* and *Roll*
and technical terms such as *Absolute Salinity* and *Potential Temperature*
should be written in various languages.

## 10. The future of oce

The present version of `oce` can only handle data types that the authors have
been using in their research. New data types will be added as the need arises
in that work, but the authors would also be happy to add other data types that
are likely to prove useful to the Oceanographic community.  (The data types
need not be restricted to Physical Oceanography, but the authors will need some
help in dealing with other types of data, given their research focus.) 

Two principles will guide the addition of data types and functions: (a) the
need, as perceived by the authors or by other contributors and (b) the ease
with which the additions can be made.  One might call this
development-by-triage, by analogy to the scheme used in Emergency Rooms to
organize medical effort efficiently.

## 11. Development website

The site [http://github.com/dankelley/oce](http://github.com/dankelley/oce)
provides a window on the development that goes on between the CRAN releases of
the package. Readers are requested to visit the site to report bugs, to suggest
new features, or just to see how `oce` development is coming along.  Note that
the `development` branch is used by the authors in their work, and is updated
so frequently that it must be considered unstable, at least in those spots
being changed on a given day.  Official CRAN releases derive from the `master`
branch, and are done when the code is considered to be of reasonable stability
and quality.  This is all in a common pattern for open-source software.

## 12. Answers to exercises

**Exercise 1.** Seawater properties.
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
swRho(34, 10, 100)
swTheta(34, 10, 100)
swRho(34, swTheta(34, 10, 100), 0)
swRho(34, swTheta(34, 10, 100, 200), 200)
plotTS(as.ctd(c(30,40),c(-2,20),rep(0,2)), grid=TRUE, col="white")
```

**Exercise 2.** Plot a profile of $\sigma_\theta$ and $N^2$, for the data in
the pycnocline. (Hint: use `subset()`.)

Although one may argue as to the limits of the pycnocline, for illustration let
us say it is in 5 dbar to 12 dbar range.  One way to do this is

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
data(ctd)
pycnocline <- ctdTrim(ctd, "range",
                      parameters=list(item="pressure", from=5, to=12))
plotProfile(pycnocline, which="density+N2")
```

Another is
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
data(ctd)
pycnocline <- subset(ctd, 5 <= pressure & pressure <= 12)
plotProfile(pycnocline, which="density+N2")
```

**Exercise 3.** Make a multi-file plot summarizing the TS relationship, with
each file showing the overall relationship in gray and the individual profile
in black. (This is an advanced exercise requiring some R skills.)

The code provided below creates 91 PNG files, with names `ar18_01.png`,
`ar18_02.png`, etc. Loading these in a view that permits quick paging through
this file list is an easy way to spot suspicious data, since each plot has the
station number at the top.  (Users trying this example should bear in mind that
this is a fairly large dataset, so the processing will take up to a minute.)

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(oce)
# http://cchdo.ucsd.edu/data/7971/ar18_58JH19941029_ct1.zip
# setwd("~/Downloads/ar18_58JH19941029_ct1")
files <- system("ls *.csv", intern=TRUE)
n <- length(files)
ctds <- vector("list", n) # to hold the CTD objects
station <- vector("list", n)
for (i in 1:n) {
    ctds[[i]] <- read.ctd(files[i])
    station[[i]] <- ctds[[i]][["station"]]
}
S <- unlist(lapply(1:n, function(i) ctds[[i]][["salinity"]]))
T <- unlist(lapply(1:n, function(i) ctds[[i]][["temperature"]]))
p <- unlist(lapply(1:n, function(i) ctds[[i]][["pressure"]]))
overall <- as.ctd(S, T, p)
png("ar18_%02d.png")
for (i in 1:n) {
    plotTS(overall, col='gray')
    lines(ctds[[i]][["salinity"]], ctds[[i]][["potential temperature"]])
    mtext(station[i], side=3, line=0)
}
dev.off()
```


**Exercise 4.** Draw a $T$-$S$ diagram for the section data, using black
symbols to the east of 30W and gray symbols to the west, thus highlighting
Mediterranean-derived waters. (Hint: use the accessor function `[[`.)

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
data(section)
ctd <- as.ctd(section[["salinity"]], section[["temperature"]], section[["pressure"]])
col <- ifelse(section[["longitude"]] > -30, "black", "gray")
plotTS(ctd, col=col)
```

**Exercise 5.** Plot dynamic height and geostrophic velocity across the Gulf
Stream. (Hint: use the `swDynamicHeight` function.)

(Try `?swDynamicHeight` for hints on smoothing.)
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
GS <- subset(section, 102 <= stationId & stationId <= 124)
dh <- swDynamicHeight(GS)
par(mfrow=c(2,1), mar=c(3, 3, 1, 1), mgp=c(2, 0.7, 0))
plot(dh$distance, dh$height, type="l", xlab="", ylab="Dyn. Height [m]")
grid()
# 1e3 metres per kilometre
f <- coriolis(GS@data$station[[1]]@metadata$latitude)
g <- gravity(GS@data$station[[1]]@metadata$latitude)
v <- diff(dh$height)/diff(dh$distance) * g / f / 1e3
plot(dh$distance[-1], v, type="l", col="blue", xlab="Distance [km]", ylab="Velocity [m/s]")
grid()
abline(h=0)
```

**Exercise 6.** Halifax sea-level during Hurricane Juan, near the end of
September, 2003.

A web search will tell you that Hurricane Juan hit about midnight, 2003-sep-28.
The first author can verify that the strongest winds occurred a bit after
midnight -- that was the time he moved to a room without windows, in fear of
flying glass.
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
data(sealevel)
# Focus on 2003-Sep-28 to 29th, the time when Hurricane Juan caused flooding
plot(sealevel,which=1,xlim=as.POSIXct(c("2003-09-24","2003-10-05"), tz="UTC"))
abline(v=as.POSIXct("2003-09-29 04:00:00", tz="UTC"), col="red")
mtext("Juan", at=as.POSIXct("2003-09-29 04:00:00", tz="UTC"), col="red")
```

**Exercise 7.** Plot the de-tided Halifax sea level during Autumn 2003, to see
whether Hurricane Juan is visible. (Hint: use `predict` with the results from
`tidem`.)

```{r results="hide", fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
data(sealevel)
m <- tidem(sealevel)
oce.plot.ts(sealevel[['time']], sealevel[['elevation']] - predict(m),
            ylab="Detided sealevel [m]", 
            xlim=c(as.POSIXct("2003-09-20"), as.POSIXct("2003-10-08")))
```

The spike reveals a surge of about 1.5m, on the 29th of September, 2003.

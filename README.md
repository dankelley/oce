## Why use R for oceanographic analysis?

The R language is popular in many branches of science, and Oceanography is no
exception. With its broad statistical support, R is a natural choice for
oceanographers in the biological, chemical and geological sub-disciplines.
However, some physical oceanographers have remained attached to Matlab, which
was widely adopted during the 1990s. Lately, this has been changing, as
oceanographers turn to open-source systems such as Python and R. A particular
strength of R is its provision of many powerful and well-vetted packages for
handling specialized calculations. The oce package is a prime example.

## What the oce package provides

The oce package handles a wide variety of tasks that come up in the analysis of
Oceanographic data. In addition to the present README file, a brief sketch of
the package has been written by the core developers (Kelley Dan E., Clark
Richards and Chantelle Layton, 2022. [oce: an R package for Oceanographic
Analysis](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03594). Journal of Open Source
Software, 7(71), 3594), and the primary developer uses the package extensively
in his book about the place of R in oceanographic analysis
(Kelley, Dan E., 2018.
[Oceanographic Analysis with R](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-8844-0).
New York. Springer-Verlag ISBN 978-1-4939-8844-0).  Details of oce functions
are provided within the R help system, and in the package
[webpage](https://dankelley.github.io/oce/).

## Installing oce

Stable versions of oce are available from CRAN, and may be installed
from within R, in the same way as other packages. However, the CRAN
version is only updated a few times a year (pursuant to policy), so many
users install the `"develop"` branch instead. This branch may be updated
several times per day, as the authors fix bugs or add features that are
motivated by day-to-day usage. This is the branch favoured by users who
need new features or who would wish to contribute to Oce development.

The easy way to install the `"develop"` branch is to execute the
following commands in R.

    remotes::install_github("dankelley/oce", ref="develop")

and most readers should also install Ocedata, with

    remotes::install_github("dankelley/ocedata", ref="main")

## Evolution of oce

Oce is emphatically an open-source system, and so the participation of
users is very important. This is why Git is used for version control of
the Oce source code, and why GitHub is the host for that code. Users are
invited to take part in the development process, by suggesting features,
by reporting bugs, or just by watching as others do such things.
Oceanography is a collaborative discipline, so it makes sense that the
evolution of Oce be similarly collaborative.

## Examples using built-in datasets

### CTD

    library(oce)
    data(ctd)
    plot(ctd, which=c(1,2,3,5), type="l", span=150)

### Acoustic Doppler profiler

    library(oce)
    data(adp)
    plot(adp)

### Sealevel and tides

    library(oce)
    data(sealevel)
    m <- tidem(sealevel)
    par(mfrow=c(2, 1))
    plot(sealevel, which=1)
    plot(m)
